## Usage

1. **Install Expo Go on Your Mobile Device:**
    - Install the Expo Go app from the [App Store (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Google Play Store (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US) on your mobile device.
2. **Start the Development Server:**
    - To run the app with Expo Go, execute the following command on your local machine:

    ```bash
        npx expo start
    ```

3. **Scan the QR Code:**
   1. **Android**
       - Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device.
       - Use the app to scan the QR code displayed in your terminal when you ran `npx expo start`.
   2. **iOS**
       - Open the Camera app on your iPhone.
       - Use your camera to scan the QR code displayed in your terminal when you ran `npx expo start`.

This will load your React Native app on your mobile device.

*Make sure you have an active internet connection because Expo Go loads the app from the Expo server during development.*
